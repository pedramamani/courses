# Undergraduate Physics at UBC

### Overview
Most of my final year courses at UBC include some programming component, even more so due to the pandemic. That prompted me to create this repository, where I keep those programming assignments, projects, and short snippets.

I have used several language here. If you (or the future me) are interested in running any of the Python code, go through the setup procedure below. The code written in other languages either requires no setup or is irrelevant to you.

### Python Setup
* Install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above and add it to your system's `PATH`
* Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to obtain required packages
* If the module you want to run requires `toolbox`, clone it [here](https://github.com/pedramamani/toolbox) and either add it to your system's `PYTHONPATH` or place it in the module directory
* Execute a module from its parent directory via `python module_name`

Thanks for coming by!
